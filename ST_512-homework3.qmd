## Problem 1

**a**

```{r}
# x=7
25-0.5*7
```

**b**
```{r}
# x=3, y=30
25-0.5*3

30-(25-0.5*3)
```
The point is above the line because the residual is positive. 

**c**
If x increases 3 units, $\hat{y}$ decreases 1.5. 
```{r}
-0.5*3
```

**d**

According to the linear model, it is predicted that the test score would be 22. However, it is not guranteed that the test score will always be 22 when training 6 hours.

**e**
```{r}
7/(16-2)
```
